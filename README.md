# AWS Steampipe Tools

AWS steampipe queries and utilities for use in steampipe against AWS. This is mostly
a place to capture ad hoc queries, scripts and ideas related to using steampipe
to analyze and report on the fleet of AWS orgs and accounts.

Queries are loosely organized around AWS services. Each service-based file has multiple queries
to use as starting points or ideas.

> !!!
The queries MUST NOT BE CONSIDERED PRODUCTION READY without review. They are scratchpad notes. Review them carefully before
doing anything irreversible based on script outputs.
